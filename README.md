This is a simple notification tool run using node.

Simply:

1. add the identifiers of the coins you which you be notified about into the 'tokensToWatch' array.
2. Change the variable 'meaningfulPercentChange' if you please. This is the percent that the value of the coin needs to trigger a desktop notification.
  - the current value is .015, which means that there must be a 2% change in value in order to a notification to trigger.

3. install the required packages with 'npm install' or 'yarn'
4. run the program with 'node index.js'
